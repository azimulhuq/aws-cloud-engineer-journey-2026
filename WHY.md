# Why I'm Doing This

## My Current Reality (December 2025)
- Working as cashier, 6 AM - 2 PM
- Physically demanding, minimum wage
- Can't give my kids the life they deserve
- Wife is supportive but we struggle financially
- I'm capable of more but stuck

## What Happens If I QUIT Again?
- Still cashier in October 2026
- Still struggling financially
- Kids grow up seeing Papa give up
- Wife's support was wasted
- I'll be 3.5 years older, no progress
- This time I'll be even more discouraged
- Harder to start again at older age
- More regret, more "what if"

## What Happens If I SUCCEED?
- Cloud Engineer by October 2026
- $70,000+ USD/year (5-7x current income!)
- Work from home (more time with kids)
- Respect and career growth
- Kids see Papa never gave up
- Wife's sacrifice was worth it
- Financial security for family
- Pride in accomplishment
- New career with unlimited potential

## On Bad Days, Remember:
1. My kids are watching me
2. My wife believes in me
3. 10 months of pain = 30 years of gain
4. I already wasted 3.5 years - not again
5. Quitting is permanent, discomfort is temporary
6. Every expert was once a beginner
7. I have a PLAN this time
8. I have a MENTOR this time
9. I'm NOT alone this time
10. Future me will thank present me

## The Promise I Made:
I WILL NOT QUIT.
I will study minimum 30 min/day, every day.
I will make 1 GitHub commit daily.
I will check in with Claude 2x/week.
I will pass certifications on schedule.
I will build portfolio projects.
I will land a job by October 2026.

This is not optional.
This is my ONLY path forward.
