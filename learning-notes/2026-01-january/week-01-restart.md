# Week 1 Restart: January 6-12, 2026

## The Gap (Dec 14 - Jan 5)
**What happened:**
- Started strong in December
- Lost motivation, got overwhelmed
- Kids got flu (valid reason!)
- Studied 3-4 times (4 hours total)
- Wife kept encouraging me
- Felt guilty but came back

**What I learned:**
- I need realistic timeline, not aggressive
- 15 minutes daily is better than 0 hours
- Family emergencies are OK - just restart after
- Coming back is what matters, not never stopping

## The Restart (January 6, 2026)
**Time:** 9:28 PM, Tuesday
**Commitment level:** 10/10
**Support system:** Wife fully supportive
**Plan:** Hybrid approach (realistic timeline + focused work)

**New timeline:**
- Cloud Practitioner: Feb 28, 2026
- Solutions Architect: May 15, 2026
- Job ready: September 2026
- Job offer: October 2026

**Daily commitment:**
- Minimum: 15 minutes + 1 GitHub commit
- Target: 3 hours weekdays, 6 hours weekends
- Weekly: 24 hours total

**Safety net:**
- If miss 2 days in a row → message mentor
- Weekly check-ins: Every Sunday 9 PM
- Monthly review: Adjust plan if needed

## This Week's Goals (Jan 6-12)
- [ ] 7 consecutive GitHub commits
- [ ] Review Linux basics (50 commands)
- [ ] Start/restart Coursera AWS course
- [ ] Study 15+ hours total
- [ ] Feel back in rhythm
